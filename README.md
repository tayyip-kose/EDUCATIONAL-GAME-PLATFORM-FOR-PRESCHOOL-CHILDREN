Preschool Educational Gaming Platform
This project leverages the power of computer vision technology to create an engaging and educational gaming platform for preschool children. As technology increasingly integrates into every facet of life, itâ€™s essential to introduce it at an early age to enhance cognitive, emotional, and motor skills.

The platform utilizes image processing to capture children's attention through visually stimulating content, making learning fun and interactive. With a user-friendly interface, the system ensures that children can easily access the educational tools, supporting their development in a digital world where technological literacy is becoming essential.

By blending traditional learning methods with cutting-edge technology, this project aims to offer an innovative educational tool that prepares preschoolers for a tech-centric future.
